# Migrate: match reference structure, TypeScript idiomatic

- When **migrating** a module (e.g. tax, shop) from Java/.NET reference:
  1. **Mirror folder structure**: Same layout as reference (client/, driver/, dsl/; client and driver are siblings; dtos under client/ and driver/ as in reference).
  2. **Mirror file structure and names**: Same file names as reference (e.g. `BaseTaxClient.ts`, `TaxStubDriver.ts`, `GetTaxVerification.ts`). One main export per file; filename = primary type name.
  3. **TypeScript idiomatic**: camelCase for methods/properties; no `I` prefix on interfaces; no `Async` suffix (use `Promise<T>`); no extra defensive defaults unless in reference.
- Reference projects: Java `core/<module>/`, .NET `Core/Core.<Module>/`. Check both when adding or moving files.
