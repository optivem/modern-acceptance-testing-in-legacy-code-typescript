# Add module: match structure, TypeScript idiomatic

- When **adding** a module (e.g. tax, shop) under core:
  1. **Mirror folder structure**: Same layout as existing modules (client/, driver/, dsl/; client and driver are siblings; dtos under client/ and driver/).
  2. **Mirror file structure and names**: Same file naming as existing core (e.g. `BaseTaxClient.ts`, `TaxStubDriver.ts`, `GetTaxVerification.ts`). One main export per file; filename = primary type name.
  3. **TypeScript idiomatic**: camelCase for methods/properties; no `I` prefix on interfaces; no `Async` suffix (use `Promise<T>`); no extra defensive defaults unless the rest of the codebase does.
