# File names match reference (idiomatic overall)

- When **migrating** or adding core modules, **file names** (and the main type/class names they export) should **match the reference** projects so the codebase stays aligned and easy to compare.
  - **.NET** `ErpApiClient.cs`, `ClockStubDriver.cs` → **TS** `ErpApiClient.ts`, `ClockStubDriver.ts` (same name; TS uses PascalCase for classes, which matches).
  - **Java** `BaseErpCommand.java` → **TS** `BaseErpCommand.ts`.
- **Idiomatic TypeScript** still wins when there is a real conflict:
  - Use **camelCase** for methods, properties, and file names if the project standard is camelCase for files (otherwise keep PascalCase for class files to match reference).
  - Prefer **one class/type per file** and **filename = primary export name** (e.g. `ClockStubClient.ts` exports `ClockStubClient`).
- **Rule of thumb:** Same logical type as in Java/.NET → same file name in TS (with `.ts`), unless the idiomatic-first rule or project convention says otherwise (e.g. no `I` prefix, no `Async` suffix in names).
