# No migration or reference mentions

- **Do not mention** Java, .NET, C#, or any other language or "reference project" in **code, comments, or documentation**.
- **Do not use** words like "migrated", "migration", "reference", "matches Java", "aligns with .NET", or similar in comments or docs.
- The project should read as a **native TypeScript codebase**. New contributors and readers must not be able to infer that it was ported from elsewhere.
- Keep guidance in other rules (structure, naming, idioms) but phrase them in terms of "this project" and "established layout" only.
