description: Restrict all changes to the commons package only; do not touch consumers

# Commons-only scope

- **Only modify** files under `commons/` (package.json, tsconfig.json, and everything under `commons/src/`).
- **Do not update** core, core-shop, optivem-testing, system-test, root package.json, or any file outside `commons/`.
- Breaking changes in consumers are acceptable: do not change or fix code in other packages to keep things working.
- When suggesting imports or dependencies, refer only to what exists inside commons (e.g. `@optivem/commons`, `@optivem/commons/dsl`, `@optivem/commons/util`). Do not propose edits to consumer code to adopt new APIs.
