# Core-only scope

- **Only modify** files under `core/` (DriverFactory, SystemConfiguration, SystemDsl, and everything under `core/commons/`, `core/erp/`, `core/shop/`, `core/tax/`).
- **Do not update** commons, optivem-testing, system-test, or any file outside `core/`.
- **Reference projects:** Align structure, naming, and behavior with:
  - Java: `modern-acceptance-testing-in-legacy-code-java/core/`
  - .NET: `modern-acceptance-testing-in-legacy-code-dotnet/Core/`
- When in doubt, match Java/.NET core layout (client, driver, dsl, dtos, verifications) and naming (camelCase in TS to mirror Java; PascalCase in .NET becomes camelCase in TS).
