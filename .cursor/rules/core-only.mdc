# Core-only scope

- **Only modify** files under `core/` (DriverFactory, SystemConfiguration, SystemDsl, and everything under `core/commons/`, `core/erp/`, `core/shop/`, `core/tax/`).
- **Do not update** commons, optivem-testing, system-test, or any file outside `core/`.
- Follow the **established core layout**: client/, driver/, dsl/, dtos, verifications; camelCase for methods/properties; one main export per file.
