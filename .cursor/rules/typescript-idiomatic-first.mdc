# Idiomatic TypeScript first

- **Prefer idiomatic TypeScript** for implementation. Reference projects (.NET/Java) guide **structure, naming, and behavior**, not literal translation of patterns that don’t fit TS.
- **Idiomatic TS patterns to use:**
  - **Union types + type narrowing:** One method that accepts `Date | string` and narrows inside (e.g. `typeof x === 'string' ? parse(x) : x`) is idiomatic; duplicating two methods where one only delegates to the other is optional, not required to “match .NET.”
  - **Single implementation with overloads for DX:** Overload signatures for clearer call-site types are fine; the implementation can still be one body that handles both cases.
  - **camelCase** for methods/properties; **no `I` prefix** on interfaces; **no `Async` suffix** (use `Promise<T>` return type).
- **When aligning with .NET/Java:** Match layout, type names, and public API shape (method names, parameters). Prefer TS-idiomatic implementation (unions, narrowing, one implementation) unless the user explicitly asks to mirror the other language’s style.
